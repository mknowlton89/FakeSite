    "description": "An empty, immaculate high-end residence. Every design object and piece of furniture occupies a specific, calculated space. The utility doesn't seem to matter or take place, the form's smoothness and perfection is everything. Everything is calm, perfect, the light embraces the space and its beautiful design. But there are other objects that escape that standard, that are of a different kind. Objects that inhabit every house, purely functional or that simply clash with the aesthetic pretension of the environment. Used and left aside, hidden, concealed, disguised, made invisible, as if they were shameful. These are the ones who break into the aseptic landscape and take it by storm. A blow worthy of a class struggle, where a useful minority rebels against pretension and sets out to tear down its symbols.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nA short film by Six N.
